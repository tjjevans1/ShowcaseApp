00:00.200 --> 00:08.433
Rubidium atoms fly at speeds of hundreds of km per hour at room temperature.

00:08.500 --> 00:12.925
With electromagnetic fields we can create a magneto-optical trap

00:12.950 --> 00:16.857
and cool the atoms to microkelvin temperatures.

00:16.900 --> 00:22.150
Atom chips can hold the atoms in a magnetic potential close to the surface.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.211
When further cooling, atoms undergo

00:24.236 --> 00:27.361
a phase transition into a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).

00:27.400 --> 00:32.901
BECs are extremely sensitive to the local magnetic field.

00:32.926 --> 00:38.257
Therefore the BEC position and shape can be manipulated with the current in the atom chip.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.955
We may place a sample above the atom chip and probe its surface current with the BEC.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.204
Magnetic field distribution is mapped onto the atomic distribution

00:47.229 --> 00:50.274
that is imaged as the shadow of a light beam.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.884
Fragmentation of the BEC  is proportional to the

00:52.909 --> 00:55.074
magnetic field component induced by the current along the surface.

00:56.260 --> 01:01.200
The 2D current distribution will be mapped

01:01.225 --> 01:06.701
by scanning the BEC position along the sample surface.
